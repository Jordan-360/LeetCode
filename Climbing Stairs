LeetCode - Easy - Climbing Stairs

You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.
Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Example 1:
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps

class Solution {
    public int climbStairs(int n) {
         if (n == 1) {
            return 1;
        }
        int[] ways = new int[n + 1];
        ways[1] = 1;
        ways[2] = 2;
        for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
            ways[i] = ways[i - 2] + ways[i - 1];
        }
        return ways[n];
    }
}
